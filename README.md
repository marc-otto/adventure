# Adventure (a text adventure)
A long time ago I started programming in Basic on my TColourGenie. I came across a book about programming text adventures, and wrote my first adventure. Now I want to do this again, while learning python.

## Python 3 ftw
Considered main stream, I chose Python3 as the version of choice.
